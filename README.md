# InsightChain

## Project Goal
The goal of the InsightChain project is to create an intuitive and interactive chatbot application that enables users to engage in natural language conversations while extracting and processing information from uploaded PDF documents. By leveraging the ChatOllama model (Llama 3.2), InsightChain aims to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses based solely on the content of the PDFs, enhancing user experience and facilitating efficient information retrieval for everyday tasks.
